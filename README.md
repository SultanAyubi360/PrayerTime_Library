## Reporting an issue

If you are going to report an issue, I will greatly appreciate you including some code which I can run to see the issue. By doing so you maximize the chance that I will fix the problem. 
By the way, before reporting a problem, try replacing DiscreteScrollView with a RecyclerView. If the problem is still present, it's likely somewhere in your code.


## Find this library useful? :heart:

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it. :coffee: :hamburger: :fries: :apple:
